	abstract = {The key problem restricting lithic microwear analysis is the lack of quantitative analysis to support qualitative assessments of different wear traces. This paper presents the reﬂective laser scanning confocal microscope ({LSCM}) as a new technique for the study of lithic microwear that has the potential to resolve this problem. Firstly, an example is presented that shows how the {LSCM} compares with conventional reﬂected light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This shows that images, rivalling that of the {SEM}, can be produced in similar timescales to conventional photomicrography and with no need for casting or sample preparation. The {LSCM} is also used to measure surface roughness of use-wear produced from working hide (dry, fresh and greasy), woodworking and antler working. This analysis demonstrates clear differences between the different wear polishes and the potential of the {LSCM} as a quantitative approach in lithic microwear research.},

	abstract = {The 3D orientation of clasts within a deposit are known to be informative on processes that formed that deposit. In archaeological sites, a portion of the clasts in the deposit are introduced by non-geological processes, and these are typically systematically recorded in archaeological excavations with total stations. By recording a second point on elongated clasts it is possible to quickly and precisely capture their orientation. The statistical and graphical techniques for analyzing these data are well published, and there is a growing set of actualistic and archaeological comparative data to help with the interpretation of the documented patterns. This paper advances this area of research in presenting methods to address some shortcomings in current methodologies. First, a method for calculating confidence intervals on orientation statistics is presented to help address the question of how many objects are needed to assess the formation of a deposit based on orientations. Second, a method for assessing the probability that two assemblages have different orientations is presented based on permutations testing. This method differs from existing ones in that it considers three-dimensional orientations rather than working separately with the two-dimensional bearing and plunge components. Third, a method is presented to examine spatial variability in orientations based on a moving windows approach. The raw data plus the R code to build this document and to implement these methods plus those already described by {McPherron} are included to help further their use in assessing archaeological site formation processes.},

Although the term clast usually refers to the natural component of a deposit, the artifactual and faunal components are also known to be sensitive to site formation processes. There are a number of ways in which orientations can be recorded and analyzed, and this paper describes how orientations can be recorded as part of piece proveniencing artifacts with a total station. After the method is described, the calculation, statistical analysis and presentation of artifact orientations are considered. The final part of the paper presents orientation data from Pech de l’Azé {IV} recorded and analyzed in this way. The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the total station method of recording orientations, their sensitivity to site formation processes, and the importance of using multiple methods of data analysis and presentation to assess and interpret patterning.},

	abstract = {Many Paleolithic lithic collections are found in contexts where post-depositional alterations, such as those made by water streams or sedimentary displacement, have affected the surface of most of the lithic artifacts. A major alteration often observed is the rounding of lithic artifacts. Although there have been some proposals on how to classify degrees of rounding—usually by employing naked eye classifications to determine degrees of rounding—there is a lack of consensus among lithic analysts. The aim of this study is to define and characterize degrees of rounding among lithic artifacts. This characterization also takes into consideration the differential development of alterations and rounding stages, depending on the raw materials. Here, an experimental program has been developed along with supplementary archaeological analysis to define and characterize degrees of rounding. Degrees of rounding are characterized according to three criteria: surface alteration, edge alteration, and width of the ridges. A preliminary characterization and proposal of degrees of rounding is presented. This characterization also takes into consideration the raw materials and the sensibility and resolution of the criteria to establish degrees of rounding. Results show how, after microscopic analysis, lithic artifacts that appear fresh to the naked present different degrees of rounding. The conclusions explain that, although rounding is continuous process, it is possible to establish degrees of rounding, a main initial goal for any lithic analyst.},

These samples exhibit mineralogical textures resulting from genomorphic and phenomorphic processes, dispersed alteration in the form of erosion as well as the dissolution and migration of more or less mobile elements. Rocks used to manufacture artefacts at Sainte-Anne 1 (Haute-Loire, France) and Payre (Ard`eche, France) show various kinds of alteration related to the range of phases of transport and deposition to which they were subjected, beginning with their first exposure in a geological context and following through to the post-depositional phase, (i.e., following abandonment as artefacts in an archaeological site). Later phenomena do not however completely obliterate stigma imprinted prior to their prehistoric collection, because the main late-phase change that occurs on flat surfaces prior to their collection is preserved in the hollows of remnant natural surfaces on archaeological tools. With the scanning electron microscope, five distinct morphologies representative of different environments have been characterised by establishing associations between the different forms and by plotting their regional distribution.},

We summarize the theoretical bases for the formation of some wear features and the main results of a number of experiments involving interaction between chert flakes and sediments. Experimental results include: (1) the wear rate of flakes is not constant; (2) the wear rate increases as the size of the grains that compose the matrix increases; (3) fine grained chert resists wear better then coarse grained chert; and (4) the presence of moisture will trigger some chemical reactions that promote wear and the formation of films on chert surfaces. We apply these findings to the cave site of Grotta di Pozzo, Italy, and conclude that, strictly within the area sampled, there is low degree of disturbance and low intensity of chemical processes that may, however, confound the reconstruction of human activities in this part of the cave.},

	abstract = {Lithic debris derived from knapping and used tools can be assimilated to simple sedimentary particles that may undergo size sorting when exposed to geomorphic processes such as streamflow or overland flow. Sorting can be identified by comparing the size distribution of archaeological assemblages to that of experimental core reduction sequences. A new database including different types of raw material (mainly flint and quartzite) and Palaeolithic debitage (blade, Levallois, discoid, on anvil, and shaping) has been built for this purpose. Palaeoeskimo data have also been added to illustrate microlithic industries. For all the debitages and raw materials, the particle size of knapping products {\textgreater}2 mm in width fits with a power-law distribution and shows only minor fluctuations, the range of which is always {\textless}15\% between experiments (all steps of the chaîne opératoire included up to the final tool). A lithic assemblage derived from block/core knapping or blank/preform production will display a particle size distribution close to the experimental distributions if not subsequently modified. Modifications may originate either from sedimentary processes or from anthropogenic factors. To help distinguishing amongst these, data on the impact of both water flows on sedimentary particles or experimental assemblages, and anthropogenic processes such as importation-exportation (of core, preforms or finished tools) or uneven spatial distribution of the different steps in core reduction and tool production within a site, are reviewed. By contrast to anthropogenic modifications, sedimentary processes are generally typified by strong impoverishment in or selective accumulation of fine-grained ({\textless}10 mm) artefacts together with a low intra-site variability (spatial homogenization) or a downslope size trend. Archaeological case studies taken from French Palaeolithic site are then detailed. Evidence for lithic redistribution implies that care should be taken in archaeological site analysis since sorting may impact significantly the initial technotypological balance of the assemblage.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {The research during the construction of the M-50 highway has allowed the study of the silica levels that constitute the most important Neolithic flint mine in the Iberian Peninsula. A group of more than 3.800 extraction pits were realized to obtain cherts and opals that appear among Mg smectites beds (Aragonian deposits). The description of the nodular and stratiform silica levels and the study of their types and distribution have been done at geological sections obtained during the archaeological excavations. Three petrological types of siliceous rocks (chert, opal and opaline chert) are established and defined according to their mineralogy and microfacies. Cherts are constituted only by quartz and locally minor amounts of moganite. Opals contain opal {CT}, Mg smectites and minor quartz. Opaline chert is defined when the proportion of quartz is higher than 50\%. All the types of siliceous rocks reproduce bioturbation structures as well as other structures found in the host rocks (grains, intraclasts, brecciation). The silica levels at the base of the columns are constituted only by chert and were formed by the silicification of nodular and lenticular dolomite levels included in the Mg-smectites beds. The rest of the siliceous levels are composed of opals and opaline cherts and were formed by silicification of Mg-smectites. The outer part of the opaline chert has a higher content in opal and clay relicts whereas the inner part is mainly microcrystalline quartz. This change is consequence of the recrystallization of the opal (aging) producing a more compact silica rock. The main silicification occurred under the groundwater table because the structure of the host rocks is conserved in the silica rocks. A general question is whether the silica that precipites is introduced by groundwater or it is released from the dissolution of clays during their replacement.},

	abstract = {The Miocene of the Madrid basin includes relatively abundant silica rocks (cherts, opals and opaline cherts), which were used during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic to make lithic tools. This work establishes the chemical characteristics that can be used to classify those silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location, explaining at the same time their mineralogical, petrological and geochemical features. The geographical classification of silica rocks is very useful to define the source areas of lithic tools made during the Prehistory. The mineralogical and petrological classification was made using transmitted light optical microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry. Chemical analyses of major, minor and rare elements were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma ({ICP}) mass and emission spectrometry. Most of the silica rocks from the Miocene of the Madrid basin were formed by the replacement of sedimentary rocks that constitute the infill of the basin. This process implies the dissolution of the host rock (limestone, dolostone, gypsum, clays, etc.) and the precipitation of silica minerals (quartz, opaline phases and moganite). Both, the chemical composition of the host rock relicts and the elements incorporated by the opaline phases, constitutes a characteristic geochemical signature from each sampled zone (sample group). Therefore, this signature can be used to define and characterize silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location. The study of the data was carried out using bivariate analysis (i.e. correlation coefficients) and multivariate analysis (i.e. main components and the discriminant function). All the chemical elements analyzed are important in the discriminant analysis, because when fewer elements are taken into account (even when only those elements with a lower weight in the discriminant function are removed), the number of samples that can be included in the groups decreases importantly.},

Its adoption in an altogether diﬀerent role in bio-assay has been determined decisively by the individual actions and personal histories of a few scholars: the widespread acceptance of the growth function is due to Pearl and Reed, the general recognition of Verhulst’s primacy to Yule, and the introduction of the function in bio-assay to Berkson.},

It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Speciÿcally, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to ÿt the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration.

It is based on the direct examination of a representative sample of stone tool by-products, and on the identification of all surface alteration features. We summarize the theoretical bases for the formation of some wear features and the main results of a number of experiments involving interaction between chert flakes and sediments. Experimental results include: (1) the wear rate of flakes is not constant; (2) the wear rate increases as the size of the grains that compose the matrix increases; (3) fine grained chert resists wear better then coarse grained chert; and (4) the presence of moisture will trigger some chemical reactions that promote wear and the formation of films on chert surfaces. We apply these findings to the cave site of Grotta di Pozzo, Italy, and conclude that, strictly within the area sampled, there is low degree of disturbance and low intensity of chemical processes that may, however, confound the reconstruction of human activities in this part of the cave.},

In this paper aiteria are examined that may prove effective in distinguishing the diverse influences potentially exerted by flowing water on artifact assemblages. These aiteria are used to analyze lithic assemblages from five excavated sites In Olduvai Gorge (1.8-1.2 my). The Olduvai sites are placed on a relative scale of influence by water flow.

	abstract = {Characterizing use-wear traces quantitatively is a valid way to improve the capacity of use-wear analysis. This aim has been on specialists’ agenda since the beginning of the discipline. Micropolish quantification is especially important, as this type of trace allows the identification of worked materials. During the last decade, confocal microscopy has been used as a promising approach to address this question. Following previous efforts in plant microwear characterization (Ibáñez et al. Journal of Archaeological Science, 48, 96–103, 2014; Journal of Archaeological Science, 73, 62–81, 2016), here we test the capacity of the method for correctly grouping experimental tools used for working eight types of materials: bone, antler, wood, fresh hide, dry hide, wild cereals, domestic cereals, and reeds. We demonstrate, for the first time, that quantitative texture analysis of use-wear micropolish based on confocal microscopy can consistently identify tools used for working different contact materials. In this way, we are able to move toward using texture analysis as part of the standard functional analysis of prehistoric instruments.},

	abstract = {Metrology has been successfully used in the last decade to quantify use-wear on stone tools. Such techniques have been mostly applied to fine-grained rocks (chert), while studies on coarse-grained raw materials have been relatively infrequent. In this study, confocal microscopy was employed to investigate polished surfaces on a coarse-grained lithology, quartzite. Wear originating from contact with five different worked materials were classified in a data-driven approach using machine learning. Two different classifiers, a decision tree and a support-vector machine, were used to assign the different textures to a worked material based on a selected number of parameters (
              Mean density of furrows
              ,
              Mean depth of furrows
              ,
              Core material volume-Vmc
              ). The method proved successful, presenting high scores for bone and hide (100\%). The obtained classification rates are satisfactory for the other worked materials, with the only exception of cane, which shows overlaps with other materials. Although the results presented here are preliminary, they can be used to develop future studies on quartzite including enlarged sample sizes.},

This study uses an instrumented particle embedded with micro electromechanical sensors ({MEMS}) to allow tracking the motions and forces acting on it, leading to and during its transport. Instrumented particle transport experiments were carried out at laboratory ﬂume under a range of ﬂow conditions. The probability distributions functions ({PDFs}) of bed load particle instantaneous velocities, hop distances and associated travel times (measured from start to stop of transport) were obtained for all the performed experiments with varying ﬂow rates and particle density. The modelled distributions are useful and enable a deeper understanding of bed load sediment transport dynamics from a Lagrangian perspective. Furthermore, the results analyzed from the instrumented particle (including the particle’s transport mode) were validated using visual particle tracking methods (top and side cameras). The ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that for the range of turbulent ﬂows trialed herein, the instrumented particle can be a useful, accessible, and low-cost tool for obtaining particle transport dynamics, having demonstrated satisfactory potential for ﬁeld deployment in the near future.},

	issn = {2773-1723},
	abstract = {In this paper a brief description is given of a number of natural surface modifications on flint, with reference to their occurrence on Palaeolithic material and on flints naturally present in boulder-sand. Boulder-sand is a residual sediment of boulder-clay (ground moraine from the penultimate glacial period). Middle-Palaeolithic finds from the Northern Netherlands probably originate from boulder-sand, considering, among other things, their natural surface modifications.

These surface modifications are dscribed with the foliowing aim mainly in view, namely to ascertain the extent to which these alterations prevent or complicate the study of traces of use. In the first place, some of these surface modifications can resemble traces of use to some extent; in such cases an attempt is made to formulate criteria to distinguish between them. In the second place, any traces of use which may have been present can be wholly or partly obliterated as a result of these surface modification processes.

It is concluded that most of the Middle Palaeolithic flints found in the Netherlands have been considerably affected by various surface modification processes, and are therefore unsuitable for a valid study of traces of use. It is important that whenever a study is being made of traces of use, the possibility of the presence of natural features should be thoroughly investigated.},

	abstract = {Lithic debris derived from knapping and used tools can be assimilated to simple sedimentary particles that may undergo size sorting when exposed to geomorphic processes such as streamﬂow or overland ﬂow. Sorting can be identiﬁed by comparing the size distribution of archaeological assemblages to that of experimental core reduction sequences. A new database including different types of raw material (mainly ﬂint and quartzite) and Palaeolithic debitage (blade, Levallois, discoid, on anvil, and shaping) has been built for this purpose. Palaeoeskimo data have also been added to illustrate microlithic industries. For all the debitages and raw materials, the particle size of knapping products {\textgreater}2 mm in width ﬁts with a power-law distribution and shows only minor ﬂuctuations, the range of which is always {\textless}15\% between experiments (all steps of the chaîne opératoire included up to the ﬁnal tool). A lithic assemblage derived from block/core knapping or blank/preform production will display a particle size distribution close to the experimental distributions if not subsequently modiﬁed. Modiﬁcations may originate either from sedimentary processes or from anthropogenic factors. To help distinguishing amongst these, data on the impact of both water ﬂows on sedimentary particles or experimental assemblages, and anthropogenic processes such as importation-exportation (of core, preforms or ﬁnished tools) or uneven spatial distribution of the different steps in core reduction and tool production within a site, are reviewed. By contrast to anthropogenic modiﬁcations, sedimentary processes are generally typiﬁed by strong impoverishment in or selective accumulation of ﬁne-grained ({\textless}10 mm) artefacts together with a low intra-site variability (spatial homogenization) or a downslope size trend. Archaeological case studies taken from French Palaeolithic site are then detailed. Evidence for lithic redistribution implies that care should be taken in archaeological site analysis since sorting may impact signiﬁcantly the initial technotypological balance of the assemblage.},

These works show that fabrics are an eﬃcient tool for assessing site formation processes. Fabrics allow discrimination between (i) undisturbed (or minimally disturbed) levels, (ii) levels that have undergone strong pedoturbations due to biological activity or to shrinking and swelling of clayey sediments and (iii) levels that have been signiﬁcantly reworked by slope processes such as periglacial soliﬂuction or overland ﬂow. However, in the present state of knowledge, fabrics do not allow precise estimation of the degree of perturbation if not associated with other archaeological and geological criteria. From the set of data on French Palaeolithic sites used here, it is demonstrated that slope dynamics and particularly soliﬂuction for sites predating the Late Glacial may have played an important role in site formation.},

	abstract = {Rock crystal is a high-quality quartz variety with an excellent aptitude for knapping. Although it is relatively uncommon, in certain geological contexts such as that of our case study, rock crystal can serve as the raw material for a substantial number of tools. Nevertheless, very little research has been devoted to the study of this material. This lack of interest may stem from a variety of sources, from the difﬁculty of analysing a translucent material to its direct attachment to the symbolic world. Here we propose a methodology for the microscopic analysis of rock crystal artefacts in order to establish a better approach for understanding the functionality of this raw material. We comprehensively analysed a series of experimental tools before use by means of different microscopic equipment ({OLM} with a Nomarski prism and {SEM}). After the initial documentation, the tools were used in a sequential experimental programme in order to monitor and document the development of use-wear traces. Fourteen experiments were conducted on different materials and with different actions in which the different use traces as well as their respective orientations and sizes were recorded over a series of established times. The set of experiments resulted in different associations of use-wear traces (striations, chipping, rounding and polish) characteristic of the various worked materials and actions employed. We also documented how a technical mark such as the lancet can provide functional information. This is due to the formation process of the mark by percussion or pressure. While lancets formed from the impact point on the ventral side are distributed radially, those created by ﬂake removal follow the kinematics of the tool. Finally, we demonstrated that rock crystal is a material that offers great possibilities for use-wear analyses once a set of technical and functional associations of mark analyses have been determined. Furthermore, although {OLM} with a Nomarski prism proved to be highly suitable in the analysis of rock crystal, its combination with other techniques such as {SEM} can provide additional information.},

However, automatic and quantitative methods (dental microwear texture and quantitative artifact microwear analyses) require highquality data to work with. Surface data acquired with confocal microscopy can reach incredible levels of ac­ curacy and resolution; yet, they are not without issues. In this paper, in an approach similar to quality control in industry, I propose a good-practice workflow for controlling the quality of the acquired and processed 3D data (height maps). I also suggest tools to deal with some of the issues commonly encountered. This workflow should be applied routinely to every height map after acquisition and processing, so that only high-quality height maps are analyzed. In turn, the systematic quality control of the 3D data improves the robustness of the quantitative results and of their interpretations.},

              th
              century. Studies of use-wear analysis have decisively contributed to a better understanding of the cognitive capacities and the socio-economic organization of Prehistoric societies. Among use-wear traces, microwear polish is the most relevant evidence, as it allows the identification of the worked materials (i.e. wood, antler, hide, bone, stone…). This identification is currently carried out through the qualitative and visual comparison of experimental and archaeological tools. During the last decade, confocal microscopy is allowing the quantitative identification of the worked material through the texture analysis of microwear polish. Previous tests have accounted for the variability of use-wear traces as caused by different types of worked material. However, how the intensity of use, which is widely recognized as an important factor conditioning microwear polish characteristics, affects our capacity to identify the worked materials is poorly understood. This research addresses the dynamic nature of microwear polish through confocal microscopy and texture analysis. This research shows that use-wear polishing is a dynamic process and surface texture evolves continuously during the working time. The evolution fits a logarithmic function, so most texture modification takes place during the first phases of work. The way in which polish texture evolves through time differs from one contact material to the other. We demonstrate that, despite the dynamic nature of use-wear polish, different worked materials can be discriminated. However, some overlapping between used and unused surfaces and between worked materials occurs in the first stages of use. Moreover, polishes of similar characteristics (i.e. bone and antler) can show similar texture at advanced stages of use. These problems in identification can be in good measure overcome by creating dynamic models of polish texture in which not only the worked material but also the time of use is considered.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the use of microscopic images as a way to define textures, and with the statistical analysis of quantitatively described textures. Digital image processing is a normal technique in archaeology. Archaeological images range from the microscopic to the macroscopic, and a diverse toolbox of computer techniques is available to process such archaeological data. However, the very nature of images as archaeological data has not been evaluated. Images are not primary data, but a transformation of empirical reality, translated into a language of luminance contrasts. Images are therefore the result of a goal-oriented modification. But how may this modification alter the reliability of the analysis? Very few studies have been published as regards this topic. Our goal in this paper is to integrate different archaeological applications of microscopy (use-wear in lithic tools, and pottery archaeometry) in order to define the observational category we are dealing with: texture. If the texture is the complex set of surface properties in an artefact, how can we describe it? What kind of archaeological, historical information do we obtain from the analysis of texture? A related problem is that of image sampling. Digital image techniques have been applied in disciplines where the assumption of surface homogeneity is valid. However, the modified surface of an archaeological artefact is always discontinuous. Different images can be obtained from the same artefact, and all of these images may be different. Statistical sampling is therefore a basic problem in archaeological image processing, and very few studies have been made. We explore the use of neural networks and related approaches to deal with this problem.},

	abstract = {Work, as physical action, modifies matter. This is the basic principle of use-wear analysis. Changes on matter by work give society those products needed for social reproduction: consumption goods. Lithic tools are part of these. We can identify the tools through use-wear analysis, in order to infer the social action.
Moreover, we should think about how to observe change of states in matter. We think we can solve it using images. We define the image as a representation arising from Reality. In this way, any image is a model of reality.
We recognise objects through images and, in this process, we define those aspects of the same objects which we consider relevant. This is a good tool for our work, but there are still some problems arising from aspects related to the inherent subjectivity of the observation process. Digital images are a possible solution, because their characteristics allow us to quantify them. We can develop a more complex quantification from the numeric values of pixels, in order to be able to analyse statistically differences between image textures.
We have quantified the description of use-wear features in order to develop knowledge that allows us to classify use alterations and determine the original use of the tool. This process is composed of several parts:
- Selection of the areas modified by use in all images, that is the selection of pixels, which have grey values related to the use alteration. Those areas are called texels.
- We select some features to describe the texels that we will quantify. The selection of features is made from our previous knowledge of use wear analysis. An objective characterisation of texels is generated using geometric variables, which will allow discriminatory measures between different use-related textures.
- Finally, a statistical analysis is used to classify the set of images into their corresponding uses.
In this paper we explain the development of this methodology using a small sample of images with alterations caused by two working matters –dry wood and dry fur– and two movements –cutting and scraping. Interconnecting both factors gives us four uses. We also explain the preliminary statistical results that we have obtained so far.},

This quantitative analysis, using confocal microscopy to study “sickle gloss” texture on ﬂint tools used for cereal harvesting, shows that wild cereals were most probably cultivated during the 13th millennium {BP} in the Middle Euphrates. At that moment, a local and continuous process of cereal domestication began to unfold in this region of the Northern Levant, lasting for over 3 millennia and culminating at the end of the 10th millennium {BP}. Thus, our research provides a new method for investigating the origins of agriculture, while the data gathered allow us to support the hypothesis of early cereal cultivation during the Younger Dryas and the protracted model of plant domestication, pointing to the Middle Euphrates as one region where this process occurred.},

Coupling reach-level channel processes with the spatial arrangement of reach morphologies, their links to hillslope processes, and external forcing by confinement, riparian vegetation, and woody debris defines a process-based framework within which to assess channel condition and response potential in mountain drainage basins. Field investigations demonstrate characteristic slope, grain size, shear stress, and roughness ranges for different reach types, observations consistent with our hypothesis that alluvial channel morphologies reflect specific roughness configurations adjusted to the relative magnitudes of sediment supply and transport capacity. Steep alluvial channels (cascade and step pool) have high ratios of transport capacity to sediment supply and are resilient to changes in discharge and sediment supply, whereas low-gradient alluvial channels (pool riffle and dune ripple) have lower transport capacity to supply ratios and thus exhibit significant and prolonged response to changes in sediment supply and discharge. General differences in the ratio of transport capacity to supply between channel types allow aggregation of reaches into source, transport, and response segments, the spatial distribution of which provides a watershed-level conceptual model linking reach morphology and channel processes. These two scales of channel network classification define a framework within which to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of channel response in mountain drainage basins.},

Downstream patterns of depositional processes can be differentiated between channel and ﬂoodplain components. In this study a generic set of methods is used to analyze ﬂoodplain initiation and continuity in relation to downstream changes in total stream power (slope and discharge) and longitudinal proﬁle form for river courses in the upper Hunter catchment, Australia. Absolute values of these controlling factors are shown to be poor indicators of threshold conditions at which ﬂoodplains begin to form along river courses. Catchment-scale patterns of stream power and the form of longitudinal proﬁles provide better predictors of this transitional zone. The total stream power plot derived along longitudinal proﬁles represented by a second-order exponential curve has a bimodal pattern. In most cases, ﬂoodplains begin to form in a transition zone characterized by a trough area within the bimodal stream power distribution. This bimodal stream power pattern provides a better means to identify this transition in depositional processes along longitudinal proﬁles than more conventional single peak stream power analyses based on ﬁrst-order exponential longitudinal proﬁles. Indirect controls such as basin geology and accommodation space also inﬂuence the initiation and pattern of ﬂoodplains.},
