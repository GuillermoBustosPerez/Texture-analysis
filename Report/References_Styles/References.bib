	abstract = {The 3D orientation of clasts within a deposit are known to be informative on processes that formed that deposit. In archaeological sites, a portion of the clasts in the deposit are introduced by non-geological processes, and these are typically systematically recorded in archaeological excavations with total stations. By recording a second point on elongated clasts it is possible to quickly and precisely capture their orientation. The statistical and graphical techniques for analyzing these data are well published, and there is a growing set of actualistic and archaeological comparative data to help with the interpretation of the documented patterns. This paper advances this area of research in presenting methods to address some shortcomings in current methodologies. First, a method for calculating confidence intervals on orientation statistics is presented to help address the question of how many objects are needed to assess the formation of a deposit based on orientations. Second, a method for assessing the probability that two assemblages have different orientations is presented based on permutations testing. This method differs from existing ones in that it considers three-dimensional orientations rather than working separately with the two-dimensional bearing and plunge components. Third, a method is presented to examine spatial variability in orientations based on a moving windows approach. The raw data plus the R code to build this document and to implement these methods plus those already described by McPherron are included to help further their use in assessing archaeological site formation processes.},

	abstract = {It is well understood that the orientation of clasts within a deposit can yield information on site formation processes. Although the term clast usually refers to the natural component of a deposit, the artifactual and faunal components are also known to be sensitive to site formation processes. There are a number of ways in which orientations can be recorded and analyzed, and this paper describes how orientations can be recorded as part of piece proveniencing artifacts with a total station. After the method is described, the calculation, statistical analysis and presentation of artifact orientations are considered. The final part of the paper presents orientation data from Pech de l’Azé IV recorded and analyzed in this way. The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the total station method of recording orientations, their sensitivity to site formation processes, and the importance of using multiple methods of data analysis and presentation to assess and interpret patterning.},

	abstract = {Many Paleolithic lithic collections are found in contexts where post-depositional alterations, such as those made by water streams or sedimentary displacement, have affected the surface of most of the lithic artifacts. A major alteration often observed is the rounding of lithic artifacts. Although there have been some proposals on how to classify degrees of rounding—usually by employing naked eye classifications to determine degrees of rounding—there is a lack of consensus among lithic analysts. The aim of this study is to define and characterize degrees of rounding among lithic artifacts. This characterization also takes into consideration the differential development of alterations and rounding stages, depending on the raw materials. Here, an experimental program has been developed along with supplementary archaeological analysis to define and characterize degrees of rounding. Degrees of rounding are characterized according to three criteria: surface alteration, edge alteration, and width of the ridges. A preliminary characterization and proposal of degrees of rounding is presented. This characterization also takes into consideration the raw materials and the sensibility and resolution of the criteria to establish degrees of rounding. Results show how, after microscopic analysis, lithic artifacts that appear fresh to the naked present different degrees of rounding. The conclusions explain that, although rounding is continuous process, it is possible to establish degrees of rounding, a main initial goal for any lithic analyst.},

Major findings from a programme of flume-based biface transportation and modification experiments are presented, demonstrating that gross factors of artefact morphology influence transportation type, and that, in turn, transportation type influences the character and distribution of damage sustained. It is argued that the data generated from these experiments can be used as the basis for modelling the type and duration of fluvial transportation secondary context bifaces have sustained, facilitating assessment of the spatial intensity of hominid activity associated with fluvial Palaeolithic findspots.},

It is based on the direct examination of a representative sample of stone tool by-products, and on the identification of all surface alteration features. We summarize the theoretical bases for the formation of some wear features and the main results of a number of experiments involving interaction between chert flakes and sediments. Experimental results include: (1) the wear rate of flakes is not constant; (2) the wear rate increases as the size of the grains that compose the matrix increases; (3) fine grained chert resists wear better then coarse grained chert; and (4) the presence of moisture will trigger some chemical reactions that promote wear and the formation of films on chert surfaces. We apply these findings to the cave site of Grotta di Pozzo, Italy, and conclude that, strictly within the area sampled, there is low degree of disturbance and low intensity of chemical processes that may, however, confound the reconstruction of human activities in this part of the cave.},

	abstract = {The research during the construction of the M-50 highway has allowed the study of the silica levels that constitute the most important Neolithic flint mine in the Iberian Peninsula. A group of more than 3.800 extraction pits were realized to obtain cherts and opals that appear among Mg smectites beds (Aragonian deposits). The description of the nodular and stratiform silica levels and the study of their types and distribution have been done at geological sections obtained during the archaeological excavations. Three petrological types of siliceous rocks (chert, opal and opaline chert) are established and defined according to their mineralogy and microfacies. Cherts are constituted only by quartz and locally minor amounts of moganite. Opals contain opal CT, Mg smectites and minor quartz. Opaline chert is defined when the proportion of quartz is higher than 50\%. All the types of siliceous rocks reproduce bioturbation structures as well as other structures found in the host rocks (grains, intraclasts, brecciation). The silica levels at the base of the columns are constituted only by chert and were formed by the silicification of nodular and lenticular dolomite levels included in the Mg-smectites beds. The rest of the siliceous levels are composed of opals and opaline cherts and were formed by silicification of Mg-smectites. The outer part of the opaline chert has a higher content in opal and clay relicts whereas the inner part is mainly microcrystalline quartz. This change is consequence of the recrystallization of the opal (aging) producing a more compact silica rock. The main silicification occurred under the groundwater table because the structure of the host rocks is conserved in the silica rocks. A general question is whether the silica that precipites is introduced by groundwater or it is released from the dissolution of clays during their replacement.},

	abstract = {The Miocene of the Madrid basin includes relatively abundant silica rocks (cherts, opals and opaline cherts), which were used during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic to make lithic tools. This work establishes the chemical characteristics that can be used to classify those silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location, explaining at the same time their mineralogical, petrological and geochemical features. The geographical classification of silica rocks is very useful to define the source areas of lithic tools made during the Prehistory. The mineralogical and petrological classification was made using transmitted light optical microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry. Chemical analyses of major, minor and rare elements were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) mass and emission spectrometry. Most of the silica rocks from the Miocene of the Madrid basin were formed by the replacement of sedimentary rocks that constitute the infill of the basin. This process implies the dissolution of the host rock (limestone, dolostone, gypsum, clays, etc.) and the precipitation of silica minerals (quartz, opaline phases and moganite). Both, the chemical composition of the host rock relicts and the elements incorporated by the opaline phases, constitutes a characteristic geochemical signature from each sampled zone (sample group). Therefore, this signature can be used to define and characterize silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location. The study of the data was carried out using bivariate analysis (i.e. correlation coefficients) and multivariate analysis (i.e. main components and the discriminant function). All the chemical elements analyzed are important in the discriminant analysis, because when fewer elements are taken into account (even when only those elements with a lower weight in the discriminant function are removed), the number of samples that can be included in the groups decreases importantly.},

In this paper aiteria are examined that may prove effective in distinguishing the diverse influences potentially exerted by flowing water on artifact assemblages. These aiteria are used to analyze lithic assemblages from five excavated sites In Olduvai Gorge (1.8-1.2 my). The Olduvai sites are placed on a relative scale of influence by water flow.

	abstract = {Sediment transport at near threshold to low transport stages (below the continuous transport) can still be affected by ﬂow turbulence and its dynamics can beneﬁt from further comprehensive studies. This study uses an instrumented particle embedded with micro electromechanical sensors (MEMS) to allow tracking the motions and forces acting on it, leading to and during its transport. Instrumented particle transport experiments were carried out at laboratory ﬂume under a range of ﬂow conditions. The probability distributions functions (PDFs) of bed load particle instantaneous velocities, hop distances and associated travel times (measured from start to stop of transport) were obtained for all the performed experiments with varying ﬂow rates and particle density. The modelled distributions are useful and enable a deeper understanding of bed load sediment transport dynamics from a Lagrangian perspective. Furthermore, the results analyzed from the instrumented particle (including the particle’s transport mode) were validated using visual particle tracking methods (top and side cameras). The ﬁndings of this study demonstrate that for the range of turbulent ﬂows trialed herein, the instrumented particle can be a useful, accessible, and low-cost tool for obtaining particle transport dynamics, having demonstrated satisfactory potential for ﬁeld deployment in the near future.},

	issn = {2773-1723},
	abstract = {In this paper a brief description is given of a number of natural surface modifications on flint, with reference to their occurrence on Palaeolithic material and on flints naturally present in boulder-sand. Boulder-sand is a residual sediment of boulder-clay (ground moraine from the penultimate glacial period). Middle-Palaeolithic finds from the Northern Netherlands probably originate from boulder-sand, considering, among other things, their natural surface modifications.

These surface modifications are dscribed with the foliowing aim mainly in view, namely to ascertain the extent to which these alterations prevent or complicate the study of traces of use. In the first place, some of these surface modifications can resemble traces of use to some extent; in such cases an attempt is made to formulate criteria to distinguish between them. In the second place, any traces of use which may have been present can be wholly or partly obliterated as a result of these surface modification processes.

It is concluded that most of the Middle Palaeolithic flints found in the Netherlands have been considerably affected by various surface modification processes, and are therefore unsuitable for a valid study of traces of use. It is important that whenever a study is being made of traces of use, the possibility of the presence of natural features should be thoroughly investigated.},

	abstract = {Lithic debris derived from knapping and used tools can be assimilated to simple sedimentary particles that may undergo size sorting when exposed to geomorphic processes such as streamﬂow or overland ﬂow. Sorting can be identiﬁed by comparing the size distribution of archaeological assemblages to that of experimental core reduction sequences. A new database including different types of raw material (mainly ﬂint and quartzite) and Palaeolithic debitage (blade, Levallois, discoid, on anvil, and shaping) has been built for this purpose. Palaeoeskimo data have also been added to illustrate microlithic industries. For all the debitages and raw materials, the particle size of knapping products {\textgreater}2 mm in width ﬁts with a power-law distribution and shows only minor ﬂuctuations, the range of which is always {\textless}15\% between experiments (all steps of the chaîne opératoire included up to the ﬁnal tool). A lithic assemblage derived from block/core knapping or blank/preform production will display a particle size distribution close to the experimental distributions if not subsequently modiﬁed. Modiﬁcations may originate either from sedimentary processes or from anthropogenic factors. To help distinguishing amongst these, data on the impact of both water ﬂows on sedimentary particles or experimental assemblages, and anthropogenic processes such as importation-exportation (of core, preforms or ﬁnished tools) or uneven spatial distribution of the different steps in core reduction and tool production within a site, are reviewed. By contrast to anthropogenic modiﬁcations, sedimentary processes are generally typiﬁed by strong impoverishment in or selective accumulation of ﬁne-grained ({\textless}10 mm) artefacts together with a low intra-site variability (spatial homogenization) or a downslope size trend. Archaeological case studies taken from French Palaeolithic site are then detailed. Evidence for lithic redistribution implies that care should be taken in archaeological site analysis since sorting may impact signiﬁcantly the initial technotypological balance of the assemblage.},

These works show that fabrics are an eﬃcient tool for assessing site formation processes. Fabrics allow discrimination between (i) undisturbed (or minimally disturbed) levels, (ii) levels that have undergone strong pedoturbations due to biological activity or to shrinking and swelling of clayey sediments and (iii) levels that have been signiﬁcantly reworked by slope processes such as periglacial soliﬂuction or overland ﬂow. However, in the present state of knowledge, fabrics do not allow precise estimation of the degree of perturbation if not associated with other archaeological and geological criteria. From the set of data on French Palaeolithic sites used here, it is demonstrated that slope dynamics and particularly soliﬂuction for sites predating the Late Glacial may have played an important role in site formation.},

Azokh Cave in the Southern Caucasus comprises a complete stratigraphic sequence of five archaeological units (Units V–I) and has yielded large Middle to early Upper Pleistocene lithic and faunal assemblages in association with hominin remains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of preservation of the lithic assemblages recovered from a marginal area at the rear of the cave and to test the feasibility of functionally analysing these artefacts. The study focused on a sample of archaeological pieces that at the macroscopic scale exhibit fresh surfaces and unaltered edges. These were analysed using various microscopes. The results obtained revealed that some archaeological artefacts from different units do preserve diagnostic usewear traces. Microwear on the archaeological pieces and a comparison of that wear with experimental results enabled us to identify features related to longitudinal actions and the working of soft material, and those related to transversal actions and the working of hard material. Based on this information, we interpreted that these artefacts were used for activities related to butchery, hideworking, and at times, woodworking.},

	abstract = {Rock crystal is a high-quality quartz variety with an excellent aptitude for knapping. Although it is relatively uncommon, in certain geological contexts such as that of our case study, rock crystal can serve as the raw material for a substantial number of tools. Nevertheless, very little research has been devoted to the study of this material. This lack of interest may stem from a variety of sources, from the difﬁculty of analysing a translucent material to its direct attachment to the symbolic world. Here we propose a methodology for the microscopic analysis of rock crystal artefacts in order to establish a better approach for understanding the functionality of this raw material. We comprehensively analysed a series of experimental tools before use by means of different microscopic equipment (OLM with a Nomarski prism and SEM). After the initial documentation, the tools were used in a sequential experimental programme in order to monitor and document the development of use-wear traces. Fourteen experiments were conducted on different materials and with different actions in which the different use traces as well as their respective orientations and sizes were recorded over a series of established times. The set of experiments resulted in different associations of use-wear traces (striations, chipping, rounding and polish) characteristic of the various worked materials and actions employed. We also documented how a technical mark such as the lancet can provide functional information. This is due to the formation process of the mark by percussion or pressure. While lancets formed from the impact point on the ventral side are distributed radially, those created by ﬂake removal follow the kinematics of the tool. Finally, we demonstrated that rock crystal is a material that offers great possibilities for use-wear analyses once a set of technical and functional associations of mark analyses have been determined. Furthermore, although OLM with a Nomarski prism proved to be highly suitable in the analysis of rock crystal, its combination with other techniques such as SEM can provide additional information.},
